# gcc2018pkg

The goal of the gcc2018pkg package is to encapsulate
a set of scripts which are useful for project organization.

## Example

The simplest example is that of populating an empty
new project directory. 

``` r
## populate_project()
```

will create folders for R/, data/, and results/ by default.
